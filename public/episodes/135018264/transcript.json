on.","startTime":78.165,"endTime":79.165,"index":39},{"text":"This is interesting.","startTime":79.675,"endTime":80.605,"index":40},{"text":"This phrase came up.","startTime":80.605,"endTime":81.765,"index":41},{"text":"We had a great question and we're sharing some related phrases.","startTime":81.765,"endTime":85.725,"index":42},{"text":"Do you wanna read the today's question for us?","startTime":85.745,"endTime":87.805,"index":43},{"text":"Yes.","startTime":87.805,"endTime":88.005,"index":44},{"text":"This question came in from Yge Kirk K and Yge says the other day, while I was talking to a friend from the US I mentioned that I had to study a lot that night and didn't have much time.","startTime":88.075,"endTime":99.405,"index":45},{"text":"She replied, so you'll hit the books, which I find quite funny and interesting.","startTime":100.105,"endTime":104.725,"index":46},{"text":"It's a phrase I hadn't heard before.","startTime":105.075,"endTime":106.565,"index":47},{"text":"That's why I thought this might be an idea for your podcast.","startTime":106.945,"endTime":109.005,"index":48},{"text":"By the way, I recently discovered your podcast and I really enjoy listening to it.","startTime":109.785,"endTime":113.925,"index":49},{"text":"Oh, that's great to know, Aubrey, isn't it?","startTime":114.225,"endTime":116.245,"index":50},{"text":"Yes.","startTime":116.305,"endTime":116.525,"index":51},{"text":"Awesome.","startTime":116.525,"endTime":116.925,"index":52},{"text":"And I can totally see why this would seem like a really funny expression, right?","startTime":117.185,"endTime":120.525,"index":53},{"text":"'cause usually a hit is like a punch or maybe you hit something with your car.","startTime":120.645,"endTime":124.645,"index":54},{"text":"So it seems weird that there's this idiom hit the book.","startTime":125.025,"endTime":127.325,"index":55},{"text":"So you imagine someone literally, yeah, hitting a book.","startTime":127.345,"endTime":129.645,"index":56},{"text":"It does seem that's not what it means.","startTime":130.105,"endTime":131.045,"index":57},{"text":"Totally agree.","startTime":131.195,"endTime":132.005,"index":58},{"text":"It's very

there.","startTime":147.825,"endTime":148.725,"index":67},{"text":"Hit the follow button, like you hit the books.","startTime":148.865,"endTime":151.045,"index":68},{"text":"It's funny, I often use

stuff.","startTime":156.915,"endTime":157.685,"index":71},{"text":"So yeah, let's talk about this phrase.","startTime":157.745,"endTime":159.285,"index":72},{"text":"Aubrey hit the

first?","startTime":160.765,"endTime":162.125,"index":75},{"text":"Yeah, it means studying.","startTime":162.125,"endTime":163.085,"index":76},{"text":"It's very specific to schoolwork, right?","startTime":163.555,"endTime":166.005,"index":77},{"text":"If you are in classes, college, high school, and you have to study for an exam, you would say, I'm gonna hit the

test, that's when we would say, I'm gonna hit the books.","startTime":174.985,"endTime":178.965,"index":80},{"text":"If you just need to study a lot.","startTime":179.145,"endTime":180.645,"index":81},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":181.035,"endTime":181.325,"index":82},{"text":"Okay, good

tonight.","startTime":188.475,"endTime":190.045,"index":87},{"text":"Yeah, but what's interesting, yeah, he is not literally hitting a book.","startTime":190.435,"endTime":193.765,"index":88},{"text":"It means he is studying.","startTime":193.825,"endTime":194.725,"index":89},{"text":"It's a funny way to say it.","startTime":194.915,"endTime":195.885,"index":90},{"text":"It's a very idiomatic.","startTime":195.885,"endTime":197.005,"index":91},{"text":"Exactly.","startTime":197.275,"endTime":197.765,"index":92},{"text":"But it's interesting to think about, you know, would you ever say this about work?","startTime":197.905,"endTime":201.925,"index":93},{"text":"Maybe if you had to read a lot of manuals or read some instructions, would you say, I'm gonna hit the books?","startTime":201.975,"endTime":207.125,"index":94},{"text":"It's a good question.","startTime":207.475,"endTime":208.245,"index":95},{"text":"You really wouldn't, this is especially reserved for being a student in school.","startTime":208.385,"endTime":213.525,"index":96},{"text":"Even if you are professional and you do study things, you, it's just, it just means you're in school.","startTime":213.955,"endTime":219.565,"index":97},{"text":"Hit the books.","startTime":219.785,"endTime":220.245,"index":98},{"text":"Exactly.","startTime":220.315,"endTime":220.805,"index":99},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":221.325,"endTime":221.445,"index":100},{"text":"So where I said, have you read up on anything lately?","startTime":221.545,"endTime":223.605,"index":101},{"text":"That's because I know you're not in school.","startTime":223.625,"endTime":225.365,"index":102},{"text":"If I knew you were registered, you know, if you were doing a PhD, I might say, I might say, have you been hitting the books lately?","startTime":225.825,"endTime":231.245,"index":103},{"text":"But where I know you're not, I would say, or have you been reading up on anything?","startTime":231.665,"endTime":235.725,"index":104},{"text":"'cause we still study.","startTime":235.925,"endTime":236.605,"index":105},{"text":"We still research.","startTime":236.705,"endTime":237.605,"index":106},{"text":"Yes.","startTime":237.865,"endTime":238.085,"index":107},{"text":"When we're not enrolled in school, but we don't hit the books.","startTime":238.085,"endTime":240.405,"index":108},{"text":"Very interesting.","startTime":240.995,"endTime":241.725,"index":109},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":241.725,"endTime":241.925,"index":110},{"text":"I mean, I'm taking an online course on Coursera right

that.","startTime":246.085,"endTime":248.885,"index":113},{"text":"I still wouldn't say I'm hitting the books when it comes to ai.","startTime":249.045,"endTime":252.205,"index":114},{"text":"No, it doesn't work, Aubrey.","startTime":252.465,"endTime":254.285,"index":115},{"text":"It's a very narrow phrase, right?","startTime":254.285,"endTime":256.205,"index":116},{"text":"You're reading up on it.","startTime":256.205,"endTime":257.125,"index":117},{"text":"That might be perfect for our next phrase here.","startTime":257.125,"endTime":259.045,"index":118},{"text":"We say study up on, study up on.","startTime":259.145,"endTime":261.645,"index":119},{"text":"This is more flexible.","startTime":261.675,"endTime":262.725,"index":120},{"text":"This means we're studying or researching anything.","startTime":262.755,"endTime":265.445,"index":121},{"text":"So you are studying up on ai.","startTime":265.625,"endTime":267.405,"index":122},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":267.795,"endTime":268.085,"index":123},{"text":"For example, here are some sample sentences.","startTime":268.385,"endTime":270.165,"index":124},{"text":"I don't know much about that.","startTime":270.845,"endTime":272.085,"index":125},{"text":"Politician's

it.","startTime":273.405,"endTime":274.605,"index":127},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":274.635,"endTime":274.925,"index":128},{"text":"So you might do this before a big election.","startTime":274.925,"endTime":276.805,"index":129},{"text":"If you're not really tuned in all the time, you need to study up on views.","startTime":277.305,"endTime":281.365,"index":130},{"text":"Or she's been studying up on emotional intelligence.","startTime":281.365,"endTime":284.525,"index":131},{"text":"I've been studying up on the Let them theory.","startTime":284.675,"endTime":287.445,"index":132},{"text":"Right?","startTime":287.495,"endTime":287.845,"index":133},{"text":"So this, you don't have to be officially enrolled in any schooling.","startTime":287.905,"endTime":291.845,"index":134},{"text":"Anything you're researching or studying about, you could use this.","startTime":292.285,"endTime":294.685,"index":135},{"text":"Yes, I love it.","startTime":295.225,"endTime":296.245,"index":136},{"text":"And then we move on to read up on now Hari, what is the difference between study up on and read up on?","startTime":296.465,"endTime":303.005,"index":137},{"text":"Yeah, these can be pretty synonymous, right?","startTime":303.235,"endTime":305.845,"index":138},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":305.845,"endTime":306.085,"index":139},{"text":"If you, you could say you're reading up on

right?","startTime":309.905,"endTime":314.125,"index":141},{"text":"This, if you study up on is more for something you're really researching, diving into, trying to study about.","startTime":314.805,"endTime":321.605,"index":142},{"text":"Whereas read up on just means you're reading a lot about, it's a little more narrow.","startTime":321.755,"endTime":325.245,"index":143},{"text":"Right?","startTime":325.245,"endTime":325.565,"index":144},{"text":"Maybe the umbrella term is study up on which you could be reading up on it, but you also could be, I don't know, taking quizzes or something.","startTime":325.855,"endTime":332.565,"index":145},{"text":"Exactly.","startTime":332.955,"endTime":333.445,"index":146},{"text":"Right.","startTime":333.655,"endTime":334.005,"index":147},{"text":"Whereas if you're just reading a lot about it, then you wouldn't say study up on just reading it.","startTime":334.485,"endTime":338.685,"index":148},{"text":"Reading up on it.","startTime":338.685,"endTime":339.365,"index":149},{"text":"For example, she's been reading up on emotional intelligence, right?","startTime":339.385,"endTime":342.605,"index":150},{"text":"Same thing.","startTime":342.635,"endTime":343.125,"index":151},{"text":"This just means maybe she's reading a lot of articles.","startTime":343.195,"endTime":345.525,"index":152},{"text":"Oh.","startTime":346.225,"endTime":346.445,"index":153},{"text":"And here we have an AI example.","startTime":346.445,"endTime":347.685,"index":154},{"text":"Love it.","startTime":347.685,"endTime":348.045,"index":155},{"text":"Nice.","startTime":348.045,"endTime":348.325,"index":156},{"text":"I need to read up on ai.","startTime":348.765,"endTime":350.005,"index":157},{"text":"I feel like there's a lot I don't know about it.","startTime":350.205,"endTime":352.925,"index":158},{"text":"Right?","startTime":353.215,"endTime":353.565,"index":159},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":353.875,"endTime":354.165,"index":160},{"text":"So these are pretty interchangeable, pretty synonymous.","startTime":354.345,"endTime":356.405,"index":161},{"text":"Just anything You're reading a lot about studying, about researching online maybe.","startTime":356.635,"endTime":360.885,"index":162},{"text":"Yeah.","startTime":361.355,"endTime":361.645,"index":163},{"text":"And I like the next one.","startTime":361.825,"endTime":362.965,"index":164},{"text":"Aubrey, did you use to cram for tests?","startTime":363.145,"endTime":365.845,"index":165},{"text":"Yes, absolutely.","startTime":366.105,"endTime":367.285,"index":166},{"text":"I was really bad at procrastinating.","startTime":367.645,"endTime":369.525,"index":167},{"text":"And then the night before an exam, I'd be up all night long cramming.","startTime":369.985,"endTime":373.485,"index":168},{"text":"Yeah, it's so, it's so bad.","startTime":373.995,"endTime":375.725,"index":169},{"text":"It's a common habit of high school kids, right?","startTime":375.725,"endTime":377.925,"index":170},{"text":"They don't pay attention during the semester and then the night before, we have to jam everything in our brains and then we let it all out after we take the test.","startTime":377.925,"endTime":384.365,"index":171},{"text":"Exactly right.","startTime":384.915,"endTime":385.725,"index":172},{"text":"This just means to study a lot at once, usually after procrastinating.","startTime":385.725,"endTime":389.485,"index":173},{"text":"But this is a little more flexible, right?","startTime":390.105,"endTime":392.045,"index":174},{"text":"Hitting the books is just about like schooling.","startTime":392.115,"endTime":395.045,"index":175},{"text":"If you also are supposed to give a presentation at work and you procrastinate it, then you could say, I'm gonna have to cram tonight.","startTime":395.705,"endTime":403.605,"index":176},{"text":"There's a lot I have to learn before I write these slides.","startTime":403.605,"endTime":406.125,"index":177},{"text":"For example, something you're doing last minute.","startTime":406.265,"endTime":408.205,"index":178},{"text":"I think it's important though, because cramming is just, is about the act of getting information into your brain.","startTime":408.645,"endTime":415.165,"index":179},{"text":"So if you're cramming to get the info in your brain to then present it, that works.","startTime":415.345,"endTime":419.725,"index":180},{"text":"But if you're exactly right, just hustling on the presentation, that would be another verb, right, Aubrey?","startTime":419.865,"endTime":424.205,"index":181},{"text":"Right.","startTime":424.495,"endTime":424.845,"index":182},{"text":"But this, if you, if there's a bunch you have to read before you create the slides.","startTime":424.865,"endTime":429.245,"index":183},{"text":"Yes.","startTime":429.545,"endTime":429.765,"index":184},{"text":"There's a, you could, you could cram last
